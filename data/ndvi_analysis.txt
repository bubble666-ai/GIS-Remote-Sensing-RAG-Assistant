NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) Analysis Guide

Overview:
NDVI is a standardized index allowing you to generate an image displaying greenness (relative biomass). This index takes advantage of the contrast of the characteristics of two bands from a multispectral raster dataset â€” the chlorophyll pigment absorptions in the red band and the high reflectivity of plant materials in the near-infrared (NIR) band.

Mathematical Formula:
NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)

Where:
- NIR = Near-infrared band reflectance
- Red = Red band reflectance

Interpretation Scale:
-1.0 to 0.0: Non-vegetated surfaces (water, snow, built-up areas)
0.0 to 0.3: Sparse vegetation
0.3 to 0.6: Moderate vegetation
0.6 to 1.0: Dense, healthy vegetation

Applications:
1. Crop health monitoring
2. Drought assessment
3. Vegetation mapping
4. Land cover classification
5. Environmental change detection

Sentinel-2 NDVI Calculation:
- Red Band: Band 4 (10m resolution)
- NIR Band: Band 8 (10m resolution)

Landsat 8 NDVI Calculation:
- Red Band: Band 4 (30m resolution)
- NIR Band: Band 5 (30m resolution)

MODIS NDVI Products:
- MOD13Q1: 16-day composite, 250m resolution
- MYD13Q1: Aqua satellite, same specifications

Limitations:
- Saturated in very dense vegetation
- Affected by atmospheric conditions
- Sensitive to soil background in sparse vegetation
- Cloud contamination affects accuracy

Best Practices:
- Perform atmospheric correction before calculation
- Use quality assessment bands to filter poor quality data
- Consider multi-temporal analysis for trend detection
- Complement with other vegetation indices for comprehensive analysis
