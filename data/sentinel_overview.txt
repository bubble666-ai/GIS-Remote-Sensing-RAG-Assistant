Sentinel Satellite Missions Overview

The Copernicus Sentinel missions provide a revolutionary approach to Earth observation, delivering operational data for a wide range of applications.

Sentinel-1: Radar Imaging
- Mission: C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
- Constellation: Two satellites (Sentinel-1A, Sentinel-1B)
- Revisit Time: 6 days (dual constellation)
- Resolution: 5x20m (strip map), 5x40m (interferometric wide swath)
- Key Features: All-weather imaging, day and night operation
- Applications: Maritime surveillance, land monitoring, emergency response

Sentinel-2: Multispectral Imaging
- Mission: Multispectral optical imaging
- Constellation: Two satellites (Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B)
- Revisit Time: 5 days (dual constellation)
- Spatial Resolution: 10m, 20m, and 60m

- Various processing levels available
- Multiple data formats supported

Processing Levels:
Level-0: Raw compressed data
Level-1A: Decompressed data, with annotations
Level-1B: Data in sensor geometry
Level-1C: Data in map geometry (top-of-atmosphere reflectance)
Level-2A: Bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance
Level-2B: Map geometry, geophysical products

Key Advantages:
