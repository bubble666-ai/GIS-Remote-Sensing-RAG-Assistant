1. Agricultural monitoring and yield prediction
2. Forest management and deforestation tracking
3. Water resource management
4. Urban planning and development monitoring
5. Disaster assessment and response
6. Climate change research
7. Geologic mapping and mineral exploration

Advantages over Previous Landsat Missions:
- Improved signal-to-noise ratio
- Additional spectral bands (coastal and cirrus)
- Higher radiometric resolution (12-bit vs 8-bit)
- More reliable calibration
- Improved data processing algorithms

Data Access:
- Free and open data access through USGS EarthExplorer
- Available in multiple data formats (GeoTIFF, HDF, etc.)
- Bulk download capabilities
- Cloud-based access through AWS and Google Cloud Platform

Quality Assessment:
- Comprehensive quality assessment bands
